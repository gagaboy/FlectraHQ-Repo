                A very high-level plan for multiple Sprints (e.g. three to twelve iteration) is created during the Release planning. It is a guideline that reflects expectations about which features will be implemented and when they are completed. It also serves as a base to monitor progress within the project.

                User Stories are managed in the Product Backlog. The User Stories are ordered according to priority. The most prioritized user stories are refined to granular level, while the least priority user stories are kept at a lesser detail level. For every sprint, the most prioritized and hence more granulated user stories are taken into the sprint backlog. If a user story is to be added to the product backlog, its priority is first determined, and it is placed according to its place as per the priority.
